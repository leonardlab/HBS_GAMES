## Repository overview

The /docs directory includes documentation for the code. 

The /src directory includes the source code.

The /tests directory includes unit and functional tests. 

The /htmlcov directory includes information on the coverage of tests in the code. See the sections on Unit tests and Functional tests for more information.

Note that the GAMES source code is all included in the src directory. All additional files are related to the Python project tools, which are described in the relevant sections below.

### Code overview

This code contains each model version in the model development process for the HBS model (model A, model B, model B2, model C, model D, and model D2). Each model version consists of 3 different topologies: a simple HBS, an HBS with HIF1a feedback, and an HBS with HIF2a feedback, and the ODEs are solved for each topology during a run of the code. To run the code for a particular model, use the config.json file with the corresponding model name at the end (e.g. for model A use config_HBS_A.json) 

## Release overview

v2.0.0 is a refactored version of the GAMES code used in Dray et al. 2022. 
This version includes a variety of Python tools for package dependencies and environment management, type annotation, linting, testing, and documentation, along with a new, improved, and more user-friendly code structure that is more amenable to extension to different models, data sets, and simulation conditions. 
Information on how to install and run each Python tool is included below. 
Python 3.10 is required.

## Installation and running instructions

1. To clone the repository, navigate to the location on your computer where you would like this repository stored and run the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leonardlab/HBS_GAMES2.git
```

2. This repository uses Poetry for packaging and dependency management. The user can create a virtual environment using poetry that includes all necessary packages and dependencies based on the pyproject.toml file. See the Python project tools - getting started section for more information.

3. Run settings are set using the config.json file in src/games/config/. The "context" variable must be set to the absolute path to the user's src/games/ folder.  In addition, the path to the config file must be set in models/set_model.py
 
4. All code is executable using the command line

To run a given module (0 = test with a single parameter set, 1 = PEM evaluation, 2 = parameter estimation, 3 = parameter profile likelihood), navigate to src/games/ and then use the command line to run the following, where x is the module number: 

```bash
$ python run.py --modules='x' 
```

Mutiple modules can be run in series. For example, the following command will run modules 2 and 3.  

```bash
$ python run.py --modules='23' 
```

## Notes on running and expanding the GAMES code

### Description of settings 

Descriptions of all settings in config.json

  - folder_name: a string defining the name of folder to save results to  

  - modelID:  a string defining the model to use, should be same name as the relevant class 

  - dataID: a string defining the data to use, .csv defining the data should be named "training_data_" + dataID, name of dataID is user-defined 

  - mechanismID: a string defining the identity of the mechanism to use, if there is only one version of a given model, this variable is unnecessary 

  - context: a string defining the absolute path to GAMES/src/games in the given context (computer) where the code will be run 

  - parameters: a list of integers defining the starting values for each parameter. If a given parameter is not free in this run, the parameter fill be fixed at the value in this list 

  - parameters_reference: a list of integers defining the reference values for each parameter, only necessary for proof-of-principle demonstrations such that the parameter used to define the training data are known 

  - parameter_labels: a list of strings defining the labels for the parameters defined in the "parameters" variable  

  - free_parameter_labels: a list of strings defining the labels for the parameters that are free in this run 

  - bounds_orders_of_magnitude: an integer defining the orders of magnitude in each direction that parameters are allowed to vary, all free parameters have these bounds by default 

  - non_default_bounds: a dictionary defining parameters  that have non-default bounds â€“ key is the parameter label and value is a list with the minimum bound as the first item and the maximum bound as the second item 

  - num_parameter_sets_global_search: an integer defining the number of parameter sets in the global search 

  - num_parameter_sets_optimization: an integer defining the number of initial guesses for optimization 

  - weight_by_error: a string ("yes" or "no") defining whether the cost function is weighted by measurement error 

  - num_pem_evaluation_datasets: an integer defining the number of pem evaluation data sets to generate 

  - parallelization: a string ("yes" or "no") defining whether the run should be parallelized 

  - num_cores: an integer defining the number of cores to parallelize the run across, not relevant if parallelization = 'no' 

  - num_noise_realizations: an integer defining the number of noise realizations to use to define the PPL threshold 

  - parameter_labels_for_ppl: a list of strings defining the parameter labels for which the PPL should be calculated 

  - default_min_step_fraction_ppl: a float defining the default fraction of the calibrated value to set the minimum step for PPL 

  - non_default_min_step_fraction_ppl: a dictionary defining non-default minimum step fraction values for PPL â€“ each key is a string with the parameter name followed by a space followed by the direction of ppl calculations (-1 or 1) and value is a float defining the non-default minimum step fraction for ppl

  - default_max_step_fraction_ppl: a float defining the default fraction of the calibrated value to set the maximum step for PPL 

  - non_default_max_step_fraction_ppl: a dictionary defining non-default maximum step fraction values for PPL â€“ each key is a string with the parameter name followed by a space followed by the direction of ppl calculations (-1 or 1) and value is a float defining the non-default maximum step fraction for ppl

  - default_max_number_steps_ppl: an integer defining the default maximum number of PPL steps in each direction 

  - non_default_number_steps_ppl: a dictionary defining non-default maximum number of PPL steps â€“ each key is a string with the parameter name followed by a space followed by the direction of ppl calculations (-1 or 1) and value is a float defining the non-default maximum number of PPL steps

### Setting fixed parameters

GAMES includes 2 methods for defining fixed parameters. 

Fixed parameters than are not anticipated to be free can be set in the gradient() method of the relevant model class (ex: k_txn for models synTF_chem or synTF).

Fixed parameters than may be fixed in some runs, but free for others (for example, k_bind in synTF_chem is free in models A, B, and C in the GAMES examples, but is fixed in model D), can be included in the parameters list in config.py.
Then, if the parameter is free in a given run, it can be included in the free_parameter_labels variable in config.py and if the parameter is fixed in a given run, it can be omitted from the free_parameter_labels variable in config.py.

### Changing run settings 

To change run settings, the user can edit the "config.json" file and change each item as needed (for example, parameter estimation method hyperparameters or free parameters). 
The user must change the "context" value to the path to the GAMES directory on their own machine.  
 
### Unit tests

We provide a small number of unit tests here as a learning tool and proof-of-principle for the testing architecture. 
The user may want to use the examples shown here to write more unit tests based on their own needs.  
The test coverage for each file is included in /htmlcov.

### Functional tests

Explicit functional tests are not included in this repository, but the infrastructure for functional testing with pytest is included. 
Simply add functional tests to the src/games/tests/functional/games/ folder and tests will automatically run with tox.

## Extending the code to a new model 

To add a new model, the user must only add a new file in the models directory and a new .csv with the experimental data file.
There are also some plotting functions (such as plot_internal_states_along_ppl in src/games/plots/plots_parameter_profile_likelihood.py and plot_training_data_fits() in src/games/plots/plots_parameter_estimation.py and  plot_timecourses() in src/games/plots/plots_timecourses.py) that must be updated for a new example. These are visualization functions that are not integral to the alogorithm itself.

### Model Class
The model file should include a class with the model name and should include the same general functions as the examples (synTF_chem, synTF). 
The model class must also be included in src/games/models/set_model.py, which defines the model class for the given run using the modelID. 
Then, other files can simply import the "model" variable and run the model-specific methods (ex: model.solve_experiment())
Below is a description of each method that each model class must have.

- init() initializes the class and sets attributes such as the state labels and sets default input and parameter values
- solve_single() solves the ODEs for a single set of parameters and inputs
- gradient() defines the ODEs
- solve_experiment() iterates over solve_single() for a set of inputs (or other independent variables). For example, for a ligand dose response, solve_experiment() includes a for loop to call solve_single() for a range of different input ligand values. More than 1 type of experiment can be included in solve_experiment using if statements for different dataIDs
- normalize_data() normalizes the simulated data. The normalization strategy must be analagous to the normalization strategy used for the experimental data. Use if/else statements if the normalization strategy differs based on different the dataID
- plot_training_data() plots the training data along with the simulated data. Use if/else statements if the type of plot differs based on different the dataID


### Training data
The experimental data file should have a similar structure to the examples provided, with the following columns
- x (independent variable)
- y (normalized dependent variable)
- y_err (normalized standard deviation for the dependent variable).

The normalization strategy used for the experimental data should also be included in the model class in the "normalize" method.
Experimental and simulated data must be normalized in the same way.


### Other considerations
The GAMES code can currently be used for up to 10 parameters (length of the parameters variable in config.json). To expand the code for more than 10 parameters, the user can simply modify solve_for_opt() in src/games/modules/parameter_estimation/optimization.py by providing more parameters as arguments for this function and unpacking the parameteters accordingly in the first line of the function.


# Python project tools

This repository uses GitHub Actions and the following tools:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependency management
- [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for automated testing
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for code formatting
- [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) for linting
- [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) for automated documentation

Make sure you have Poetry installed.
The other tools will be installed by Poetry.

## Getting started

1. Install pyenv. Note that this repo is not compatible with Anaconda and instead uses pyenv and poetry to manage environments.

Mac/Linux users can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as a package manager to help install pyenv and poetry.
To install homebrew, type the following command into your command line interface (Terminal).

```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Then, to install pyenv, run

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install pyenv
```

To initialize pyenv properly, the following code needs to be added to your ~/.bash_profile or your ~/.zshrc. Make sure this is at the end of the file. 

```
if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
  eval "$(pyenv init -)"
fi
```

Finally, to install Python 3.10.8, run the following.

```
$ pyenv install 3.10.8
```

To see which Python versions are installed, run the following.

```
$ pyenv versions --list
```

If you are running windows, you can install [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win).

2. Install poetry according to the following instructions: [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) 

3. Clone the repo (see Installation and running instructions for details).

4. Activate the environment using poetry (this is all you need for day-to-day development). You will need the package pyenv installed, with Python 3.10 available.

```bash
$ poetry shell
```

5. Install dependencies.

```bash
$ poetry install
```

6. Run a test with the command line interface (CLI). If the --modules option is not specified, the default module (0) will run. Before running the test, navigate to the src/games/ folder.

```bash
$ python run.py
```

## Repository tools

### Poetry

Poetry makes it explicit what dependencies (and what versions of those dependencies) are necessary for the project.
When new dependencies are added, Poetry performs an exhaustive dependency resolution to make sure that all the dependencies (and their versions) can work together.

To add a dependency, use:

```
$ poetry add <dependency>
```

You can additionally specify version constraints (e.g. `<dependency>@<version constraints>`).
Use `-D` to indicate development dependencies.
You can also add dependencies directly to the file.

### Tox

Running tox will automatically perform unit and functional tests, linting, formatting, and type checking. 

Tox can be configured in `tox.ini` for additional python versions or testing environments.

You can run tox by simply running

```bash
$ tox 
```

### Pylint

Pylint checks for basic errors in the code and aims to enforce a coding standard.
The tool will score code out of 10.
Most recommendations from Pylint are good, but it is not perfect; make sure to be deliberate with which messages you ignore and which recommendations you follow.

Pylint can be configured in `.pylintrc` to ignore specific messages (such as `missing-module-docstring`), exclude certain variable names that Pylint considers too short, and adjust additional settings when relevant.

### Mypy

Mypy performs static type checking, which can make it easier to find bugs and removes the need to add tests solely for type checking.

### Sphinx

We used Sphinx to automatically generate documentation using Numpy style docstrings - [Numpy style docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). Documentation for each module can be found in 'GAMES/docs/build_'.

Note that to generate documentation, the absolute path to config.json must be specified in src/games/config/settings.py.
